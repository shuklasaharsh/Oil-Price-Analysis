- We have GDP data that is sector based.
- We have individual oil prices.
- We aim to find if there is a correlation between the taxes that the governements collects on the sold oil vs the Macroeconomic factors of the country itself.

- brentOILprices.csv has the oil prices indices that specify the cost per barrel internationally.
- GDP_INDIA.csv is the official RBI data that has the sectorwise GDP growth of the country per quater for the decade 2010-20
- Individual RSP data for the years 19,20,21 (Present) for major Metro cities.
- New.Csv is the processed data that has all the dates converted into a format that can be recognised by Pandas.
- Unemployment.csv is Unemployment Data from 2019 to 2020

## Phase 2 of project
- Collection of more data.
- Cleaning of the said data.

## Phase 3
- Processing the data into meaningful outputs and visualisations

## Phase 4
- Using Econometric tests and confirming if there is a correlation present

## Notebook not Visible

- Getting the message "Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?" when viewing an *.ipynb on a GitHub blob page.
```diff
+ Probably a problem with the GitHub notebook viewing tool - sometimes github fails to render the ipynb notebooks, 
+ I believe that is some temporary (and recurring) issue with their backend

- A workaround

+ Try to open that notebook that you want using nbviewer online, you don't need to install it.
```
### Open "https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/"
### Paste the links 
- [Data-organising.ipynb](https://github.com/shuklasaharsh/Oil-Price-Analysis-Data/blob/main/Data-organising.ipynb)
- [Visualisation-and-analytics.ipynb](https://github.com/shuklasaharsh/Oil-Price-Analysis-Data/blob/main/Visualisation%20and%20analytics.ipynb)

```diff
+ The Notebook should be visible.
